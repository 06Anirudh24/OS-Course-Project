Zombie: If parent doesnt invoke wait(), then child is terminated but not 
removed from process table. Happens when child completes before the parent.
We CANT kill a zombie... init has to be used to execute wait().  

Orphan: Process whose parent is terminated, i.e., when child is still 
executing, parent has teminated without calling wait(). When the child also 
completes exec, the orphan turns into a zombie.
